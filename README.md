# marlinctl

Marlinctl 2.X provides an improved process management command line interface for setting up the different components of the Marlin network.

# Stable releases

If you wish to run stable releases compiled by marlin team, please use our public release artifacts. Following is marlinctl 2.0.0 for you.
```
wget http://public.artifacts.marlin.pro/projects/marlinctl/2.0.0/marlinctl-2.0.0-linux-amd64 --output-document=/usr/local/bin/marlinctl
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/marlinctl
```
If you run `marlinctl -v && md5sum /usr/local/bin/marlinctl`, it should return the following valid results for latest release:
```
marlinctl version 2.0.0 build master@ea6097ddcacf62be617fbc605e64c19db426fd1f
Compiled on: 03-01-2021_09-18-09@UTC
bec6caaa7c6336485964165b9e29edfd  marlinctl-2.0.0-linux-amd64
```
The newest marlinctl will show the following version string however. If the following is higher than the version described above, your marlinctl will upgrade to the following in some time after a few command invocations (Try operations like `sudo marlinctl beacon versions` to invoke an upgrade if you want to manually trigger upgrade).
```
marlinctl version 2.4.0 build master@fbeb735bc0b07eafbac32e094990a4d5b29ed992
Compiled on: 27-04-2021_09-42-09@UTC
```

Always try running the latest version of marlinctl. Marlinctl will auto-update by default if new versions are found upstream.


# Cloning

$ git clone https://github.com/marlinprotocol/marlinctl2.git
```

# Building

Only for development purposes, not for release builds unless by marlin team.

Prerequisites: go >= 1.15.1, make, supervisord, supervisorctl

To build marlinctl2 tagged with version 2.0.0 from repository, run
```
$ sh mk.sh 2.0.0
```
A `marlinctl` executable should be built inside the `build` directory

# Usage

Root access is needed to run commands, be sure to run it with sudo if you are not the root user.

To get list of available commands, run

```
$ sudo marlinctl --help
```

The cli is fully explorable, so every subcommand at all depths has a `--help` option. For example, running
```
$ sudo marlinctl beacon --help
```
will list the subcommands available w.r.t the beacon and running
```
$ sudo marlinctl beacon create --help
```
will print the usage and the cli options available.
